## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d578e4d: One HTTP/2 session per provider on Node, opened when the provider is constructed (nothing is sent on it until the first operation; `warm: 'prime'` pays the fast-token prime up front as well), every request a stream on it. An idle session does not keep the process alive, and `GmnClient.close()` lets it go. A burst of 100 concurrent creates over `fetch` opened 100 TLS connections whose handshakes ran one after another on the one thread; over one session the same burst measured a 40 ms median time-to-interactive against 211 ms, from us-east-1. `fetch` stays the fallback where `node:http2` is missing or a session cannot be opened, and is selected by an injected `fetch`; `transport: 'fetch' | 'http2' | 'auto'` chooses explicitly.

  `fastToken` defaults to `absorb` again: the door has answered a `gmnt_` token from memory since the day `prime` became the default, and the prime itself is a workspace listing that crosses to the database (113 to 140 ms). Measured from us-east-1 at 100 concurrent creates over one session, 56 to 106 ms median time-to-interactive with no prime against 166 ms waiting on one. `warm: 'prime'` and `fastToken: 'prime'` keep the warm-up for callers who want it.

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [3914faa]
  - computesdk@4.1.5
  - @computesdk/provider@2.1.6

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 7ff592a: `fastToken` now defaults to `prime`: one cheap, single-flighted warm-up request per process, so even the first creates of a burst present the signed credential instead of each paying the authentication read. Pass `fastToken: 'absorb'` to keep the previous behaviour (no extra request; the first request pays the ordinary cost).

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 88e078e: Surface the API's error message instead of `[object Object]`.

  The door answers a refusal with `{"error": {"code", "message"}}`, but the
  client ran `String()` over that object, so every non-2xx response arrived
  with its explanation discarded. Since the check sits in the shared request
  path, this affected every operation: create, exec, fork, snapshot and
  prepare-image.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- d0d29df: Add givemeanode provider
- d0d29df: givemeanode: map `vcpus`/`cpus`/`resources.vcpus` onto named instance types, surface the door's 1 MiB stdout truncation on stderr, fall back to the service token when a signed credential is refused early, keep the request deadline over the response body, refuse a plaintext `baseUrl`, and treat `memory` as decimal MB.
