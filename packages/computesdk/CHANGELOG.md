## 4.1.9

### Patch Changes

- f1a8578: Add `sandbox.startProcess()` for interactive long-running processes: daemond gains stdin-capable detached jobs (`stdin`/`closeStdin` messages, bounded output buffers, `command.stdin.closed` events), and the provider factory implements `startProcess` once for all providers.
- Updated dependencies [f1a8578]
  - daemond@0.1.7

## 4.1.8

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [1157237]
  - daemond@0.1.6

## 4.1.7

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [7e65fe7]
  - daemond@0.1.5

## 4.1.6

### Patch Changes

- 0732fed: Add `execution: "persistent"` mode to the Archil provider: `create` provisions a
  persistent Archil sandbox VM (waited to `running`), `runCommand` uses the
  sandbox's interactive process API over a short-lived WebSocket connection
  (fresh connection URL per command), `getById` auto-resumes paused sandboxes,
  `destroy` deletes the sandbox, and `getUrl` resolves published endpoints.
  Default `execution: "exec"` behavior is unchanged.

  Also adds `ephemeral?: boolean` to the shared `CreateSandboxOptions` as the
  standard flag for providers with both ephemeral and persistent compute
  surfaces, and wires it through every dual-mode provider:

  - Archil: `ephemeral: true` -> exec-mode disk handle, `false` -> persistent VM.
  - Upstash: `ephemeral` -> `EphemeralBox`/`Box` (unchanged semantics, now typed).
  - Cloud Run: `ephemeral` overrides configured `executionMode` per sandbox
    (`true` -> `ephemeral`, `false` -> `stateful`).
  - Freestyle: `ephemeral` overrides configured `persistent` per sandbox
    (`true` -> deleted on stop, `false` -> kept).
  - daemond@0.1.4

## 4.1.5

### Patch Changes

- 3914faa: Fix disk sizing on sandbox create: `ephemeralDiskMb` was passed under a name the Tensorlake SDK's `Sandbox.create` ignores — it now maps to `diskMb`, so the requested disk size is honored. `SandboxResourceOptions` gains a typed `diskMb` field (Tensorlake), and the adapter accepts `diskMb` directly with `ephemeralDiskMb` kept as an alias.
  - daemond@0.1.4

## 4.1.4

### Patch Changes

- f3fe311: Add typed `SandboxResourceOptions` to `CreateSandboxOptions`

  - Introduce `SandboxResourceOptions` (CPU/memory/disk knobs), `RunloopLaunchParameters`, and `VercelSandboxResources` types, exported from `computesdk` and `@computesdk/provider`.
  - `CreateSandboxOptions` now extends `SandboxResourceOptions` and types `runtime`, `image`, `deploymentPlan`, `size`, `vmTier`, `resources`, and `launch_parameters`, so callers can replace `Record<string, any>` resource maps with `Partial<CreateSandboxOptions>` / `SandboxResourceOptions`.
  - `@computesdk/isorun`: cast `options.runtime` to the provider `Runtime` type now that the field is typed as `string`.
  - `@computesdk/runloop`: destructure `launch_parameters` out of passthrough options and merge it into the devbox `launch_parameters` instead of relying on the spread, fixing a type clash with the Runloop SDK's `LaunchParameters`.
  - daemond@0.1.4

## 4.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 607a11b: Redesign `@computesdk/bench` with a suite-based API and move benchmark recording into the bench package.

  **`@computesdk/bench` (breaking)**

  - Replace single-shot `bench.run(operation, fn, options)` with a suite API: `bench.add(name, fn)` + `bench.run(options)`
  - `createBench()` now requires a `label` field — the human-readable suite name used as the primary grouping key in benchmark events
  - Task functions receive a `BenchContext` (`ctx.iteration`, `ctx.phase`, `ctx.taskName`, `ctx.log(...)`) instead of a bare iteration index
  - `ctx.log()` entries are attached as redacted `logs[]` on the benchmark span for that iteration
  - Remove `sdkVersion` from `BenchConfig` — version is now auto-detected via build-time injection
  - Add optional `apiUrl` / `apiKey` on `BenchConfig`; when omitted, events are local-only via `onEvent`
  - Upload benchmark events in background batches with a bounded queue and best-effort final flush
  - Add optional `groupId` and `shard` metadata for multi-process/sharded benchmark runs
  - Add optional `captureOutput.file` / `captureOutput.flushInterval` to emit tailed process output as `benchmark.output` events
  - Return type changes from `BenchResult` to `BenchSuiteResult` with per-task stats

  **`@computesdk/bench` benchmark primitives**

  - Add `BenchSuiteEvent` (`benchmark.suite`) emitted once per `bench.run()` with label, task names, provider, iterations, and warmup
  - Add `BenchEvent`, `BenchSpanEvent`, `BenchOutputEvent`, and `BenchAttempt` types
  - Add shared benchmark helpers for IDs, runtime detection, error codes, and event emission
  - Print a Tinybench-style summary table to stdout after `bench.run()` completes

  **`computesdk` (patch)**

  - Remove the experimental automatic telemetry configuration/export surface while bench is redesigned independently
  - daemond@0.1.4

## 4.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [1519626]
  - daemond@0.1.4

## 4.1.1

### Patch Changes

- eca5ec2: Remove `RunCommandOptions.daemon` from the public API and make command streaming callback-driven.

  `sandbox.runCommand(...)` now automatically uses daemon-backed streaming internally when `onStdout` and/or `onStderr` callbacks are provided.

  This also removes the need for daemon prewarming in callers and updates provider behavior/tests to treat streaming as an internal transport detail.

## 4.1.0

### Minor Changes

- cc79d78: Add `daemond` as a runtime dependency and re-export daemon seed helpers/types from the `computesdk` package entrypoint.

  Also extend `RunCommandOptions` with an optional `daemon` field (`boolean | SeedScriptConfig`) so provider-backed sandboxes can opt into daemonized command execution via `sandbox.runCommand(...)`.

  In `@computesdk/provider`, add runtime handling for `runCommand(..., { daemon })` in generated sandbox instances: commands are routed through `daemond` seed launcher, parsed, and normalized into `CommandResult`.

  Also add daemon output callback support via `RunCommandOptions.onStdout` / `RunCommandOptions.onStderr`. When daemon SSE is available from a prior daemon invocation, callbacks receive streamed command chunks; otherwise callbacks receive final parsed stdout/stderr as fallback.

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- aa4ca58: Remove `Runtime` concept from SDK

  The `Runtime` type (`'node' | 'python' | 'deno' | 'bun'`) and associated
  `getSupportedRuntimes()` method were originally designed to support a
  `runCode()` API that has since been removed. With no runtime-dispatch logic
  remaining in the SDK, these are dead API surface.

  **Breaking changes:**

  - `Runtime` type removed from `computesdk` public exports
  - `runtime` field removed from `SandboxInfo`
  - `getSupportedRuntimes(): Runtime[]` removed from the `Provider` interface
  - Provider implementations no longer need to (and cannot) implement `getSupportedRuntimes()`
  - Test suite no longer iterates per-runtime; tests run once per sandbox

  **Migration:** Remove any calls to `provider.getSupportedRuntimes()` and any
  references to `SandboxInfo.runtime` in your code.

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- 371f667: Remove the legacy daemon/client subsystem.

  **Breaking changes (`computesdk`):**

  - Removed the `Sandbox` client class and its entire `src/client/` subsystem (WebSocket protocol, resources, terminal/run/server/watcher/file/env/sessionToken/magicLink/signal/auth/child namespaces).
  - Removed re-exports: `Sandbox`, `SandboxStatus`, `ProviderSandboxInfo`, `CommandExitError`, `isCommandExitError`, `TerminalInstance`, `FileWatcher`, `SignalService`, `WebSocketConstructor`, `encodeBinaryMessage`, `decodeBinaryMessage`, `MessageType`, `buildSetupPayload`, `encodeSetupPayload`, `SetupPayload`, `SetupOverlayConfig`.
  - Removed the 11 optional advanced namespaces (`terminal?`, `run?`, `server?`, `watcher?`, `file?`, `env?`, `sessionToken?`, `magicLink?`, `signal?`, `auth?`, `child?`) from the `SandboxInterface`.
  - Removed `SandboxOverlayConfig`, `SandboxServerConfig`, `SandboxHealthCheckConfig` types.
  - Removed `overlays` and `servers` fields from `CreateSandboxOptions`.

  These APIs were only wired against the daemon transport, which was removed from the published package earlier. No shipped provider implemented them.

  **Breaking changes (`@computesdk/workbench`):**

  - Removed `workbench connect <url> [token]` (required the deleted `Sandbox` client class).
  - Removed `workbench provider local` and local-daemon auto-attach (required the deleted `Sandbox` client class).
  - Removed `mode gateway|direct` toggle and `provider direct <name>` / `provider gateway <name>` aliases.
  - Dropped the `child`, `server`, and `terminal` REPL bindings — they delegated to daemon-only namespaces.
  - Dropped `ws` runtime dependency.

  **Breaking changes (`@computesdk/cli`):**

  - Removed `pty` mode. `compute connect`, `compute sandbox connect`, `workspace attach`, and `sandbox create --connect` now drop into the REPL (`runCommand`-based) instead of an interactive PTY shell.
  - Removed the `/shell` REPL command that dropped into PTY.

  **Other:**

  - `@computesdk/provider` drops the optional `findOrCreate` / `find` / `extendTimeout` fields from `SandboxMethods` (matching the earlier compute-wrapper cleanup).
  - 14 provider packages get a patch bump for internal destructuring cleanup (removed unused `overlays` / `servers` destructure targets).

## 2.6.0

### Minor Changes

- a321f01: Remove hosted control-plane assumptions from `computesdk` and move to direct provider mode.

  ### `computesdk`

  - Remove gateway/control-plane transport from `compute`; `compute.sandbox.*` now routes directly to configured provider instances.
  - Replace legacy config pathways with direct provider configuration only:
    - `compute.setConfig({ provider })`
    - `compute.setConfig({ providers: [...] })`
  - Add multi-provider routing support with:
    - `provider` + `providers` support
    - `providerStrategy` (`priority` / `round-robin`)
    - `fallbackOnError`
    - per-call provider override (`{ provider: 'name' }`)
  - Remove legacy hosted/gateway modules and exports (`auto-detect`, `explicit-config`, provider env/config exports).
  - Replace provider compatibility tests with direct-provider contract tests and new CI integration coverage.

  ### `@computesdk/provider`

  - Remove deprecated `defineCompute` and compute-factory exports that depended on hosted control-plane behavior.
  - Keep direct provider APIs (`defineProvider`, `createCompute`, `defineInfraProvider`).

  ### `@computesdk/railway` and `@computesdk/render`

  - Remove control-plane compute wrapper behavior.
  - Package entrypoints now throw explicit migration errors explaining that these wrappers are no longer supported after control-plane removal.

  ### `@computesdk/workbench`

  - Remove dependency on deleted `computesdk` provider config exports.
  - Inline provider env/auth metadata and switch compute instantiation to direct provider instances in both mode paths.
  - This preserves workbench mode UX while removing legacy control-plane config usage.

  ### Migration Notes

  - Stop using legacy config shapes such as provider-name strings with control-plane keys.
  - Configure `computesdk` with provider instances from provider packages.
  - For infrastructure packages previously used as control-plane wrappers (`@computesdk/railway`, `@computesdk/render`), migrate to supported direct provider packages.

## 2.5.4

### Patch Changes

## 2.3.0

### Minor Changes

- d49d036: implement refactored provider package for namespace

## 2.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 5b010a3: Fix filesystem operations for absolute paths

  The `encodeFilePath` function was incorrectly stripping the leading slash from absolute paths, causing `readFile`, `getFile`, `deleteFile`, and `checkFileExists` to fail when using absolute paths like `/tmp/foo.txt`.

  Before: `readFile("/tmp/foo.txt")` would send `GET /files/tmp/foo.txt` (relative path)
  After: `readFile("/tmp/foo.txt")` now sends `GET /files//tmp/foo.txt` (absolute path preserved)

  This fix ensures the server can correctly distinguish between absolute and relative file paths.

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 53506ed: Introducing ComputeSDK 2.0 with the Sandbox Gateway.

  The Gateway allows you to use the same SDK with ANY provider—including your existing cloud infrastructure—by simply bringing your own keys. Change providers by updating environment variables, not code.

  **Supported Providers (8):** E2B, Modal, Railway, Vercel, Daytona, Render, Blaxel, and Namespace.

  **New Features:**

  - **Namespaces**: Organize sandboxes by user, project, or entity. Combined with named sandboxes, enables idempotent creation via `compute.sandbox.findOrCreate()`.

  - **Servers**: Supervised processes with full lifecycle management:

    - `install` command that runs before `start` (e.g., `npm install`)
    - Restart policies: `never`, `on-failure`, `always`
    - Health checks for readiness detection
    - Graceful shutdown with SIGTERM/SIGKILL handling

  - **Overlays**: Instantly bootstrap sandboxes from template directories:

    - `smart` strategy uses symlinks for instant setup
    - Background copying for heavy directories
    - `waitForCompletion` option to block until ready

  - **Client-Side Access**: Delegate sandbox access to browser clients securely:

    - Session tokens for scoped credentials
    - Magic links for one-click browser authentication

  - **File Watchers**: Real-time filesystem change events via WebSocket

  - **Signal Service**: Port detection and error events for dev server workflows

  - **Environment Management**: First-class `.env` file operations

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- Introducing the **Sandbox Gateway** as a first-class citizen in ComputeSDK v2.

  - `run.command('cmd', { background: true, waitForCompletion: true })` - wait for background command
  - `run.waitForCompletion(terminalId, cmdId)` - wait for background command manually
  - Background command results now include `cmdId` and `terminalId` for manual tracking

## 1.15.0

### Minor Changes

- 25341eb: Breaking: Update SDK types to match server-core PR #95 API changes

  **Server API Changes:**

  - Rename `command` field to `start` in `ServerStartOptions` and `ServerInfo`
  - Add `install` optional field for install commands that run before start (e.g., "npm install")
  - Add `installing` status to `ServerStatus` type

  **Overlay API Changes:**

  - Rename `symlinkedFiles`/`symlinkedDirs` to `copiedFiles`/`copiedDirs` in `OverlayStats`
  - Add `ignore` option to `CreateOverlayOptions` for glob patterns to exclude (e.g., `["node_modules", "*.log"]`)
  - Update documentation to reflect direct file copying instead of symlinking

  Migration:

  ```typescript
  // Before
  await sandbox.server.start({ slug: "api", command: "npm run dev" });
  console.log(server.command);

  // After
  await sandbox.server.start({ slug: "api", start: "npm run dev" });
  // Or with install:
  await sandbox.server.start({
    slug: "api",
    install: "npm install",
    start: "npm run dev",
  });
  console.log(server.start);

  // Overlay stats
  console.log(overlay.stats.copiedFiles); // was: symlinkedFiles
  console.log(overlay.stats.copiedDirs); // was: symlinkedDirs
  ```

## 1.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 0c58ba9: Add server logs API for retrieving captured output from managed servers

  - Add `sandbox.server.logs(slug)` to retrieve combined stdout/stderr logs
  - Add `sandbox.server.logs(slug, { stream: 'stdout' })` to get only stdout
  - Add `sandbox.server.logs(slug, { stream: 'stderr' })` to get only stderr
  - Returns `ServerLogsInfo` with slug, stream type, and logs content

## 1.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 3333388: Add filesystem overlay API for instant sandbox setup from template directories

  - Add `sandbox.filesystem.overlay.create({ source, target })` to create overlays
  - Add `sandbox.filesystem.overlay.list()` to list all overlays
  - Add `sandbox.filesystem.overlay.retrieve(id)` to get overlay status (useful for polling)
  - Add `sandbox.filesystem.overlay.destroy(id)` to delete overlays
  - Overlays symlink template files for instant access, then copy heavy directories in background

## 1.12.1

### Patch Changes

- 4decff7: feat: Add @computesdk/gateway package and remove mode system

  - New `@computesdk/gateway` package with Railway infrastructure provider for gateway server use
  - New `defineInfraProvider()` factory for infrastructure-only providers
  - New `defineCompute()` factory for user-facing gateway routing
  - Simplified `@computesdk/railway` from ~270 lines to ~55 lines (routes through gateway)
  - Removed mode system (`ProviderMode`, `BaseProviderConfig`, `defaultMode`)
  - Configurable Docker image with `computesdk/compute:latest` default
  - Export `ExplicitComputeConfig` type from computesdk

## 1.12.0

### Minor Changes

- fdda069: Add supervisor/daemon capabilities to server service

  - Add restart policies: `never`, `on-failure`, `always`
  - Add graceful shutdown with configurable timeout (SIGTERM → wait → SIGKILL)
  - Add inline environment variables support
  - Add process monitoring with `restart_count` and `exit_code` tracking
  - Expose server namespace in workbench REPL for testing

## 1.11.1

### Patch Changes

- 7c8d968: ## Handle `status: "creating"` in `find()` and `findOrCreate()`

  Added polling support for the gateway's new sandbox lifecycle status tracking. When a sandbox is being created by a concurrent request, the gateway now returns `status: "creating"` instead of creating a duplicate sandbox.

  The SDK now polls with exponential backoff (500ms → 2s, 1.5x factor) until the sandbox becomes ready or times out after 60 seconds.

  This is the client-side companion to computesdk/edge#97.

## 1.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 40d66fc: ## Streaming Output Support for `runCommand()`

  Added `onStdout` and `onStderr` callback options to `sandbox.runCommand()` for real-time output streaming:

  ```typescript
  await sandbox.runCommand("npm install", {
    onStdout: (data) => process.stdout.write(data),
    onStderr: (data) => process.stderr.write(data),
  });
  ```

  ### Streaming Modes

  | `background` | callbacks             | Behavior                           |
  | ------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
  | `false`      | none                  | Wait for completion, return result |
  | `true`       | none                  | Return immediately                 |
  | `false`      | `onStdout`/`onStderr` | Stream output, wait for completion |
  | `true`       | `onStdout`/`onStderr` | Stream output, return immediately  |

  ### Two-Phase Streaming Flow

  Implemented a two-phase streaming protocol to prevent race conditions with fast commands:

  1. `POST /run/command` with `stream: true` returns a pending command with `cmd_id` and `channel`
  2. SDK subscribes to the channel via WebSocket
  3. SDK sends `command:start` to trigger execution
  4. Server broadcasts `command:stdout`, `command:stderr`, `command:exit` events

  This ensures the SDK is subscribed before the command runs.

  ## `sandbox.destroy()` Fix

  Fixed `sandbox.destroy()` to actually destroy the sandbox via the gateway API, not just disconnect the WebSocket.

  ## Provider Compatibility Tests

  Added comprehensive provider compatibility test suite that validates SDK functionality across providers (e2b, vercel, daytona, modal). Tests cover:

  - Sandbox lifecycle (create, connect, destroy)
  - File operations (read, write, exists, remove, mkdir, readdir)
  - Command execution (with cwd, env, background, streaming)
  - PTY terminals (create, write, output streaming, destroy)
  - Exec terminals (execute commands with result tracking)
  - URL generation for different ports

  ## CI Integration

  Added SDK integration test job to CI workflow that runs provider compatibility tests against e2b and vercel providers on PRs and main branch pushes.

  ## Workbench Improvements

  - Added SDK debugging documentation to README with examples for reproducing test failures
  - Added verbose mode for WebSocket debugging
  - Improved terminal and filesystem commands
  - Added `cd` command support

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [40d66fc]
  - @computesdk/cmd@0.4.1

## 1.10.3

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [6b0c820]
  - @computesdk/cmd@0.4.0

## 1.10.2

### Patch Changes

- 07e0953: Add setConfig() method, remove runtime parameter, UI package, and web framework examples

  **Breaking Changes:**

  - Removed `runtime` parameter from gateway's `CreateSandboxOptions` - runtime is determined by the provider, not specified at creation time
  - Removed `handleComputeRequest` and related web framework integration exports (no longer needed)
  - Removed `@computesdk/ui` package (built for pre-gateway architecture, will be redesigned for gateway)
  - Removed web framework examples (Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit, Remix, Astro) - will be rebuilt for gateway architecture
  - Use `sandbox.runCode(code, runtime)` to specify which runtime to use for execution

  **New Features:**

  - Added `compute.setConfig()` method for explicit configuration
  - Updated error messages to reference `setConfig()` instead of callable pattern

  **Two Ways to Use ComputeSDK:**

  1. **Using ComputeSDK** (recommended):

     - `import { compute } from 'computesdk'`
     - Zero-config with environment variables or explicit `compute.setConfig()`
     - Works with all providers through unified interface

  2. **Using providers directly** (advanced):
     - `import { e2b } from '@computesdk/e2b'`
     - Use provider SDKs directly without ComputeSDK wrapper
     - Useful for local providers (Docker) or provider-specific features

  **Runtime Selection:**
  Runtime is no longer specified at sandbox creation. Instead, specify it when executing code:

  - `sandbox.runCode(pythonCode, 'python')` - Execute Python code
  - `sandbox.runCode(nodeCode, 'node')` - Execute Node.js code

  **Updated Examples:**
  All provider examples now demonstrate **using ComputeSDK**:

  - e2b-example.ts - Using ComputeSDK with E2B provider
  - modal-example.ts - Using ComputeSDK with Modal provider
  - daytona-example.ts - Using ComputeSDK with Daytona provider
  - docker-example.ts - Using Docker provider directly (local, no gateway)
  - runloop-example.ts - Using ComputeSDK with Runloop provider
  - codesandbox-example.ts - Using ComputeSDK with CodeSandbox provider
  - blaxel-example.ts - Using ComputeSDK with Blaxel provider
  - vercel-example.ts - Using ComputeSDK with Vercel provider

  **Example Usage:**

  ```typescript
  // Using ComputeSDK with setConfig (recommended)
  import { compute } from "computesdk";
  compute.setConfig({
    provider: "e2b",
    apiKey: "computesdk_xxx",
    e2b: { apiKey: "e2b_xxx" },
  });
  const sandbox = await compute.sandbox.create();

  // Using ComputeSDK with zero-config (auto-detection)
  // Just set COMPUTESDK_API_KEY and E2B_API_KEY environment variables
  import { compute } from "computesdk";
  const sandbox = await compute.sandbox.create();

  // Using Docker provider directly (for local providers)
  import { docker } from "@computesdk/docker";
  const compute = docker({ image: { name: "python:3.11" } });
  const sandbox = await compute.sandbox.create();
  ```

## 1.10.1

### Patch Changes

- fa18a99: # Grandmother/Mother/Children Architecture Refactor

  Major architectural refactoring that splits computesdk into a clean three-tier structure.

  ## New Architecture

  - **computesdk** (Grandmother) - User-facing SDK with gateway HTTP + Sandbox client
  - **@computesdk/provider** (Mother) - Provider framework for building custom providers
  - **Provider packages** (Children) - Import from @computesdk/provider

  ## Changes to computesdk

  - Removed `setConfig()`, `getConfig()`, `clearConfig()` methods from compute singleton
  - Removed `createCompute()` (moved to @computesdk/provider)
  - Gateway now uses direct HTTP implementation (not a provider)
  - Merged @computesdk/client into computesdk package
  - Renamed `sandbox.kill()` → `sandbox.destroy()`

  ## New @computesdk/provider Package

  Contains the provider framework extracted from computesdk:

  - `defineProvider()` function for defining custom providers (renamed from `createProvider()`)
  - `createCompute()` for direct mode
  - Provider types and interfaces (Provider, ProviderSandbox, etc.)
  - Universal Sandbox interface types

  ### Why `defineProvider()`?

  We renamed `createProvider()` to `defineProvider()` to match modern framework conventions and improve developer experience:

  **Pattern Recognition:**

  - Vite: `defineConfig()`
  - Nuxt: `defineNuxtConfig()`
  - Vue: `defineComponent()`

  **Better Semantics:**

  - `createProvider` implies creating an instance (it actually returns a factory definition)
  - `defineProvider` means "define what this provider is" (accurate to what it does)
  - More intuitive for developers familiar with modern frameworks

  **Example:**

  ```typescript
  import { defineProvider } from "@computesdk/provider";

  export const modal = defineProvider({
    name: "modal",
    defaultMode: "direct",
    sandbox: {
      /* ... */
    },
    methods: {
      /* ... */
    },
  });
  ```

  ## Provider Package Updates

  All 12 provider packages now:

  - Import `defineProvider` from @computesdk/provider
  - Import types from @computesdk/provider (which re-exports from computesdk)
  - Have @computesdk/provider as a dependency

  ## Migration Guide

  ### Gateway Mode (unchanged)

  ```typescript
  import { compute } from "computesdk";
  const sandbox = await compute.sandbox.create(); // Auto-detects from env
  ```

  ### Direct Mode (new location)

  ```typescript
  import { createCompute } from "@computesdk/provider";
  import { e2b } from "@computesdk/e2b";

  const compute = createCompute({ defaultProvider: e2b({ apiKey: "xxx" }) });
  const sandbox = await compute.sandbox.create();
  ```

  ### Method Rename

  ```typescript
  // Before
  await sandbox.kill();

  // After
  await sandbox.destroy();
  ```

## 1.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 38caad9: Update gateway provider to use plural `/v1/sandboxes` endpoints for REST consistency

  - `POST /v1/sandboxes` - Create a new sandbox
  - `GET /v1/sandboxes/:id` - Get sandbox info
  - `DELETE /v1/sandboxes/:id` - Destroy sandbox
  - `POST /v1/sandboxes/:id/extend` - Extend sandbox expiration
  - `POST /v1/sandboxes/find-or-create` - Find or create by namespace/name
  - `POST /v1/sandboxes/find` - Find by namespace/name

  **Breaking Change:** Requires gateway version with plural endpoints (computesdk/edge#80)

- f2d4273: Add named sandbox support, extend timeout functionality, and child sandbox REPL access

  ## Named Sandboxes

  Sandboxes can now be referenced by stable (namespace, name) identifiers instead of just provider-generated UUIDs.

  **New Methods:**

  - `compute.sandbox.findOrCreate({ name, namespace?, timeout? })` - Find existing or create new sandbox by (namespace, name)
  - `compute.sandbox.find({ name, namespace? })` - Find existing sandbox without creating

  **Example:**

  ```typescript
  // First call - creates new sandbox
  const sandbox1 = await compute.sandbox.findOrCreate({
    name: "my-app",
    namespace: "user-123",
  });

  // Later call - returns same sandbox
  const sandbox2 = await compute.sandbox.findOrCreate({
    name: "my-app",
    namespace: "user-123",
  });
  // sandbox1.sandboxId === sandbox2.sandboxId
  ```

  **Features:**

  - Namespace-based isolation (different namespaces = different sandboxes)
  - Default namespace of "default" when not specified
  - Automatic stale mapping cleanup
  - Works with gateway provider

  ## Extend Timeout

  You can now extend the timeout/expiration of an existing sandbox to keep it alive longer:

  **New Method:**

  - `compute.sandbox.extendTimeout(sandboxId, options?)` - Extend sandbox timeout

  **Example:**

  ```typescript
  // Extend timeout by default 15 minutes
  await compute.sandbox.extendTimeout("sandbox-123");

  // Extend timeout by custom duration (30 minutes)
  await compute.sandbox.extendTimeout("sandbox-123", {
    duration: 30 * 60 * 1000,
  });

  // Useful with named sandboxes
  const sandbox = await compute.sandbox.findOrCreate({
    name: "long-running-task",
    namespace: "user-alice",
  });

  // Extend timeout before it expires
  await compute.sandbox.extendTimeout(sandbox.sandboxId, {
    duration: 60 * 60 * 1000, // 1 hour
  });
  ```

  **Features:**

  - Default extension duration is 15 minutes (900000ms)
  - Only available with gateway provider
  - Gateway endpoint: `POST /v1/sandbox/:id/extend`

  ## Named Sandboxes in Workbench

  The workbench REPL now supports creating and managing named sandboxes:

  **New REPL Methods:**

  - `create({ name?, namespace?, ...options })` - Create sandbox with optional name/namespace
  - `findOrCreate({ name, namespace?, ...options })` - Find or create named sandbox
  - `find({ name, namespace? })` - Find existing named sandbox

  **Example (in workbench REPL):**

  ```javascript
  // Create sandbox with name and namespace (no await needed)
  const sandbox = create({ name: "my-app", namespace: "user-123" });

  // Find or create named sandbox
  const sandbox = findOrCreate({ name: "my-app", namespace: "user-123" });

  // Find existing sandbox
  const existing = find({ name: "my-app", namespace: "user-123" });
  ```

  **Features:**

  - Gateway mode only (use `mode gateway` to enable)
  - Promises are auto-awaited (no need for `await` keyword)
  - Auto-completion support
  - Documented in help command

  ## Child Sandboxes in Workbench

  The workbench REPL now exposes child sandbox operations:

  **New REPL Methods:**

  - `child.create()` - Create a child sandbox
  - `child.list()` - List all child sandboxes
  - `child.retrieve(subdomain)` - Get info about a specific child
  - `child.destroy(subdomain, options?)` - Delete a child sandbox

  **Example (in workbench REPL):**

  ```javascript
  // Create a child sandbox (no await needed - promises are auto-awaited)
  const child = child.create();
  console.log(child.url); // https://sandbox-12345.sandbox.computesdk.com

  // List all children
  const children = child.list();

  // Delete a child
  child.destroy("sandbox-12345", { deleteFiles: true });
  ```

  **Features:**

  - Gateway mode only (use `mode gateway` to enable)
  - Works similar to `filesystem` namespace in REPL
  - Promises are auto-awaited (no need for `await` keyword)
  - Auto-completion support
  - Documented in help command

### Patch Changes

- f38470d: Fix getInstance() typing when using createCompute() with direct providers

  Fixed a type inference issue where `sandbox.getInstance()` returned `unknown` instead of the provider's native sandbox type when using `createCompute()` with a direct provider (e.g., E2B, Modal).

  The issue was caused by a forward declaration of the `Provider` interface in `sandbox.ts` that shadowed the real `Provider` interface from `provider.ts`, preventing proper type extraction.

  **Before:**

  ```typescript
  const provider = e2b({ apiKey: "key" });
  const compute = createCompute({ defaultProvider: provider });
  const sandbox = await compute.sandbox.create();
  const instance = sandbox.getInstance(); // Type: unknown ❌
  ```

  **After:**

  ```typescript
  const provider = e2b({ apiKey: "key" });
  const compute = createCompute({ defaultProvider: provider });
  const sandbox = await compute.sandbox.create();
  const instance = sandbox.getInstance(); // Type: E2BSandbox ✅
  const id = instance.sandboxId; // Works! ✅

### Minor Changes

- 763a9a7: Fix getInstance() typing to return provider-specific sandbox types

  The `getInstance()` method now returns properly typed provider instances instead of the generic `Sandbox` type. This enables full TypeScript intellisense and type safety when working with provider-specific methods and properties.

  **Before:**

  ```typescript
  const instance = sandbox.getInstance(); // Returns generic Sandbox
  // No intellisense for E2B-specific methods
  ```

  **After:**

  ```typescript
  const compute = createCompute({
    defaultProvider: e2b({ apiKey: "your-key" }),
  });

  const sandbox = await compute.sandbox.create();
  const instance = sandbox.getInstance(); // Returns properly typed E2B Sandbox
  // Full intellisense: instance.sandboxId, instance.commands, instance.files, etc.
  ```

  This change uses a phantom type approach (`__sandboxType`) to preserve type information through the provider chain, enabling TypeScript to correctly infer the native sandbox type.

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 19e4fe6: Add createCompute() function with proper getInstance() typing

  - Add new createCompute() function that preserves provider type information
  - Fix getInstance() returning 'any' type when using default provider configuration
  - Add TypedComputeAPI interface for type-safe compute operations
  - Maintain full backward compatibility with existing compute singleton

  Usage:

  ```typescript
  import { createCompute } from "computesdk";
  import { e2b } from "@computesdk/e2b";

  const compute = createCompute({
    defaultProvider: e2b({ apiKey: "your-key" }),
  });

  const sandbox = await compute.sandbox.create();
  const instance = sandbox.getInstance(); // ✅ Properly typed!
  ```

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- ede314a: Improve getInstance() type inference with generic setConfig. When using setConfig with a defaultProvider, getInstance() now returns the properly typed native provider instance instead of 'any', enabling full type safety and autocomplete for provider-specific APIs.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 3b23385: swtiching to core e2b package (whoops)

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- be556c2: Fix getInstance() type inference to eliminate need for manual type casting

  Previously, `getInstance()` required explicit type parameters even when providers implemented typed methods:

  ```typescript
  // Before (required manual casting)
  await sandbox.getInstance<E2BSandbox>().setTimeout(minDurationMs);
  ```

  Now type inference works automatically:

  ```typescript
  // After (automatic type inference)
  await sandbox.getInstance().setTimeout(minDurationMs);
  ```

  **Technical Details:**

  - Fixed factory's `getInstance()` method to use proper generic constraints
  - Updated Sandbox interface with function overloads for better type inference
  - Preserved backward compatibility with explicit type parameters
  - Added comprehensive test coverage for type inference scenarios

  **Root Cause:**
  The factory was casting provider-specific types through `unknown`, breaking TypeScript's type inference chain.

  **Solution:**

  - Constrained generic `T` to extend `TSandbox` for safe casting
  - Added overloaded signatures to support both implicit and explicit typing
  - Removed unnecessary `unknown` type casting that broke inference
