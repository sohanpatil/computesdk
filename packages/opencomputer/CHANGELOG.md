## 1.0.4

### Patch Changes

- c93cc2d: Start the `@opencomputer/sdk` import at module load instead of at first use.

  The SDK initialises at import. `loadSandbox()` is first reached from
  `sandbox.create()`, so deferring the import there meant that initialisation
  happened during the first create rather than before it.

  The import stays dynamic: the SDK is ESM-only with top-level await, so a static
  import compiles to `require()` in this package's CJS build and fails to load.
