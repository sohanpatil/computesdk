### Patch Changes

- 87b2324: Add the Run Cloud provider with Firecracker sandbox lifecycle, commands, filesystem operations, and snapshots.
- 87b2324: Open and close Run Cloud public port URLs through the `@run-cloud/sdk` tunnel API, releasing an expiring tunnel when it is refreshed so long-lived sandboxes stay within the active tunnel limits. Also give the ESM bundle a `createRequire` shim, since bundling the ESM-only SDK inlines `ws` and its CommonJS sources call `require`.
- 87b2324: Automatically attach an idempotency key to Run Cloud sandbox creates when the caller does not supply one.
