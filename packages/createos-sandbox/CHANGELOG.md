# @computesdk/createos-sandbox

## 0.1.13

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [f1a8578]
  - @computesdk/provider@2.1.10

## 0.1.12

### Patch Changes

- @computesdk/provider@2.1.9

## 0.1.11

### Patch Changes

- ea5be06: Harden the relative `filesystem.*` path resolution: `remove(''|'.'|'./')` no longer collapses to the sandbox workdir (it is rejected before resolution instead of recursively deleting it), and a failed `pwd` workdir probe is evicted instead of being cached as `/` forever — the next filesystem operation probes again.

## 0.1.10

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [7e65fe7]
  - @computesdk/provider@2.1.8

## 0.1.9

### Patch Changes

- a5b4353: Accept relative paths in `sandbox.filesystem` operations. Providers whose native file APIs require absolute paths (Modal `filesystem.*`, createos `files.*`, Sail `fs.*`) previously rejected or misrouted relative paths; they are now resolved against the sandbox's exec working directory — probed once via `pwd` and cached — so `filesystem.writeFile('a.txt', ...)` and `runCommand('cat a.txt')` address the same file. Absolute paths skip the probe entirely; `.` segments and duplicate slashes are normalized, while `..` segments are left for the sandbox filesystem to resolve physically.

## 0.1.8

- @computesdk/provider@2.1.7

## 0.1.7

### Patch Changes

- @computesdk/provider@2.1.6

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- b832bc8: Bump `@nodeops-createos/sandbox` to `^0.8.1` and track `latest` for `@opencomputer/sdk`.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [6ec91ff]
  - @computesdk/provider@2.1.5

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- 45e4f80: Forward timeout to createos-sandbox exec requests

  The `runCommand` method now passes `options.timeout` as `timeoutMs` to the underlying `@nodeops-createos/sandbox` exec call. Previously the timeout was ignored and the SDK used a hardcoded 60s default, causing long-running commands (e.g. dax benchmark) to time out.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [f3fe311]
  - @computesdk/provider@2.1.4

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 6d47c0e: Fix and improve createos-sandbox provider (bump to @nodeops-createos/sandbox@0.7.1).

  - Performance improvement by reducing double calls.
  - Default `ingressEnabled` to `false` (was `true`) for both create and fork requests.
  - Default rootfs to `devbox:1` when no image/runtime/rootfs is specified.
  - Use direct HTTP DELETE for sandbox destroy instead of fetching the sandbox first.
  - Add new create options: `envs`, `name`.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- bdf7c2b: Add CreateOS provider — VM sandboxes via `@nodeops-createos/sandbox`. Maps `create`/`runCommand`/filesystem/`getInfo` and pause-as-snapshot with `fork` onto the ComputeSDK provider contract, plus a native-handle escape hatch (`getInstance`) for pause/resume/disks/bandwidth. Template builds use the native client directly (ComputeSDK's `Provider` type can't carry the createos `dockerfile` option type-safely).
